 # ContinueThe.Quest Overview

 ContinueThe.Quest (CTQ) is a collaborative storytelling platform that empowers users and AI to expand and complete unfinished or alternate story universes across various media (books, movies, TV shows, games). CTQ is designed to foster a community-driven environment with incentivized contributions, robust moderation, and efficient handling of large-scale user-generated content.

 ## End Goal

 - Users can create **Media** entries (e.g., a franchise or source material).
 - Within each Media, users define **Branches** (e.g., "before", "after", or alternate takes on the story).
 - Within each Branch, users post **Segments** (chapters or story sections), authored by humans or generated by AI.
 - All content supports tiered comments, voting, and tagging.
 - The system tracks storage and API usage, enforces user-specific quotas, and manages a credit-based economy for AI generation and other paid actions.
 - Authentication is passkey-first (WebAuthn) with optional fallback passphrase.
 - Credits are earned and spent for specific actions (e.g., generating AI segments, purchasing new tags).
 - Large textual content and user assets are stored on disk for efficiency.

 ## Project Goals (Summary)

 - **Collaboration**: Enable users to build upon and finish stories in a shared, versioned environment.
 - **Performance & Scalability**: Handle large volumes of text and assets while providing fast response times.
 - **Community Engagement**: Encourage contributions through comments, votes, tags, and credits.
 - **Robust Moderation**: Provide tools for banning, throttling, and monitoring to maintain community integrity.
 - **AI Integration**: Offer on-demand AI-assisted story completion while carefully managing credits, disk usage, and API costs.
