● Now let me work on adding a logs viewing section to the admin panel. First, I need to understand what kind of logs exist in the system and where they might be stored.

● Task(Find log files and systems)
  ⎿  Done (26 tool uses · 50.0k tokens · 2m 19.5s)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

● Great! Now I have a good understanding of the logging system. Let me create a comprehensive logs viewing section for the admin panel. I'll start by creating the HTML page, then the JavaScript, and finally the API endpoints.

● Write(pages/admin-logs.html)
  ⎿  Wrote 194 lines to pages/admin-logs.html                                  
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

● Now let me create the JavaScript file for the logs management system:

● Write(pages/js/admin-logs.js)
  ⎿  Wrote 530 lines to pages/js/admin-logs.js
     // /pages/js/admin-logs.js
     // Admin Logs Management System
     class AdminLogsManager {
         constructor() {
             this.logs = [];
             this.filteredLogs = [];
             this.currentPage = 1;
             this.perPage = 50;
             this.totalPages = 1;
