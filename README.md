## 📖 Project Overview

ContinueThe.Quest is a collaborative storytelling platform that allows users and AI to expand and continue unfinished stories or universes from various media sources such as TV shows, movies, books, and games. Users can add original media, create story branches, write or generate content segments, and interact through comments, votes, and tags. The goal is to foster a dynamic community-driven environment that scales efficiently and is highly performant.

### Core Concepts

*   **Media**: The source material or universe (e.g., a book, movie, or game).
*   **Branches**: Specific storylines within a Media (e.g., a prequel, sequel, or alternate reality).
*   **Segments**: The individual chapters or scenes that make up a Branch, which can be written by users or generated by AI.

## ✨ Features

*   **Collaborative Storytelling**: Create and expand stories with a global community.
*   **AI-Assisted Content**: Use credits to generate story segments with AI.
*   **WebAuthn (Passkey) First**: Secure, passwordless authentication with passphrase fallback.
*   **Credit System**: Earn credits for contributions and spend them on features like AI generation.
*   **Tagging & Voting**: Organize and rank content with a flexible tagging and voting system.
*   **User-Generated Content**: Upload cover images, write bios, and contribute to stories.
*   **Markdown Support**: Write and format story segments with Markdown.
